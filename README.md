# 07-2D-Platformer

This is Photobound, a remake of a game of the same name that I helped make for Ludum Dare 31 (Which is available here: https://jellonator.itch.io/photobound). This iteration of Photobound is created with Godot 3.2.1.

Photobound is a 2D puzzle platforming game where the screen boundaries are solid, and solving puzzles involves leveraging this mechanic. There are currently 5 levels with 10 collectibles total.

## Controls

 * Jump - Z
 * Pick Up/Drop - X
 * Move - Arrow Keys
 * Restart - R
 * Pause - Escape
 
 Rebindable controls will be implemented later.
